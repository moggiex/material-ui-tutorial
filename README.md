## What I liked & disliked

- This was a really good introduction to using MUI (5)
- I now appreciate the approach of using components to separate everything out and deviated from the tutorial numerous times to follow my own path with MUI elements and also to play with components.
- Holding off further judgement on MUI until I look at Next.js
- Oh and the hardest thing I see with MUI is remembering each of the components. This is why I enjoyed this tutorial, the author was always referencing back to the MUI docs here https://mui.com/components/

## How could I expand upon this project?

- Play with more components. May were left untouched
- I did go further than what was demonstrated and broke everything sensibly out into separate components
